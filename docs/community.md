# Community Standards

The Crawler community is quite large,
and with that we have a specific set of standards that we apply in our community.

All of our project spaces are covered by the [Django Community Code of Conduct](https://djangoproject.com/conduct/).

### Feedback

Any issues can be sent directly to our [project mailing list](mailto:community@crawler.com).
